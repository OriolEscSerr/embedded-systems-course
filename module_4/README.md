# Module 4 – Course 1 Final Assessment

This folder contains my work for **Module 4** of the *Introduction to Embedded Systems Software and Development Environments* course offered by the University of Colorado Boulder.

## Module Summary

In this module, I applied the knowledge gained in Modules 1 through 3 to develop and test memory manipulation software. The focus was on writing low-level C functions that interact with memory, integrating these into an existing build system using Make and GCC, and evaluating their functionality through host-based simulation.

Topics covered include:

- Writing C functions for memory manipulation  
- Simulating and testing code on the host machine  
- Integrating new components into the build system  
- Conducting and participating in code reviews

## Learning Achievements

As part of this module, I was able to:

- Implement memory manipulation routines in C  
- Compile and test applications on the host platform using GCC  
- Extend a Makefile-based build system to include new source files  
- Perform detailed reviews of peer code to identify strengths and suggest improvements  
- Reflect on software quality, maintainability, and design through real-world feedback
