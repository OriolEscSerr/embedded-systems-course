# Module 2 – Compilations with GCC and GNU Make

This folder contains my work for **Module 2** of the *Introduction to Embedded Systems Software and Development Environments* course offered by the University of Colorado Boulder.

## Module Summary

In this module, I was introduced to software build systems and their role in transforming high-level source code into architecture-specific binaries. The module emphasized the importance of understanding the compilation process and using build tools effectively to ensure maintainable and portable embedded software.

Topics covered include:

- Structure and purpose of build systems in embedded development  
- The role of the preprocessor in compilation  
- Use of the GCC compiler toolchain  
- Writing Makefiles to automate builds  
- Integration of libraries and cross-compilation techniques  
- Analysis of different build output formats

As part of the module, I created a custom Makefile and used it to build, analyze, and manage an embedded software project using both native and cross-compilation approaches.

## Learning Achievements

As part of this module, I was able to:

- Implement a complete build system using GNU Make and GCC  
- Examine the effect of preprocessor directives during compilation  
- Integrate external libraries into my project build  
- Write a Makefile that supports both native and cross-compilation targets  
- Generate and inspect various build outputs including:  
  - Preprocessed source files  
  - Assembly code  
  - Object files  
  - Dependency files  
  - Executables  
  - Memory map files
