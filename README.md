## Course Description

This intermediate-level course (~9 hours total) provides:

- Real-world coding experience and hands-on project work with ARM‑based microcontrollers.  
- Implementation of software configuration management and development of embedded software applications.  
- Creation of a build system using the GNU toolchain (GCC and GNU Make), along with Git version control in a Linux virtual machine environment.  
- Writing of C programs that define data in different memory regions.  
- A final project where students build their own build system and firmware capable of manipulating memory.  

The course consists of **4 modules**, including quizzes and peer-reviewed assignments.
