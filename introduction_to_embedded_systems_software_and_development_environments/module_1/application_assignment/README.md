# Week 1 Application Assignment
**Statistical Analysis in C**

This project is the first assignment of Module 1 in the *Introduction to Embedded Systems Software and Development Environments* course (Coursera – University of Colorado Boulder, Prof. Alex Fosdick).

The goal of the assignment is to get familiar with C programming, working with arrays and functions, compiling from the command line using GCC, and managing the project using Git.

## What the Program Does

The program works with a fixed array of 40 `unsigned char` values. It performs the following operations:

- **Calculates and prints statistics**: minimum, maximum, mean, and median.
- **Sorts the array** from largest to smallest.
- **Prints the array** to the terminal before and after sorting.
- Uses clean output formatting for all statistics and data.

All statistical values are rounded down to the nearest integer.

## Files Included

- `stats.c` – Contains all function definitions.
- `stats.h` – Contains function declarations and documentation.
- `README.md` – Project description and metadata (this file).

Developed by **Oriol Escolà Serra** as part of the course requirements.
