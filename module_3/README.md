# Module 3 – Memory Systems in Embedded Design

This folder contains my work for **Module 3** of the *Introduction to Embedded Systems Software and Development Environments* course offered by the University of Colorado Boulder.

## Module Summary

In this module, I was introduced to important embedded concepts related to memory systems and their role in software design. The module focused on how software maps to hardware, especially in distinguishing between program code and program data. Memory systems vary by platform and architecture, and this module covered key foundational concepts needed to effectively use all parts of an embedded system’s memory.

Topics covered include:

- Components of a program’s memory space for both code and data regions  
- Defining data in different memory regions using C  
- Interpretation of application’s map and linker files  
- Usage of GCC Binary Utilities to investigate memory usage  
- Analysis of map files for memory usage  
- Determining where compiled code and data symbols are allocated, their lifetimes, and access restrictions

As part of the module, I worked with C programs and toolchains to explore how memory is allocated and represented, using tools like GCC and linker scripts to examine memory regions in embedded applications.

## Learning Achievements

As part of this module, I was able to:

- Analyze the components of a program’s memory space for both code and data regions  
- Write C-programs to define data in different memory regions  
- Interpret application’s map and linker files  
- Use GCC Binary Utilities to investigate the memory usage of an executable  
- Investigate the map file for the memory usage of an executable  
- Determine where compiled code and data symbols are allocated, the lifetime of these symbols and the access restrictions
